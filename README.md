# dam-web-ring

I wanted to have a similar web-ring manager to grantlemon's web ring manager,
so I wrote my own, gleam style.

To join the web ring please add the following links to your website:

- `https://dam-ring.pdx.land/next?referer=<YOUR_DOMAIN>`
- `https://dam-ring.pdx.land/prev?referer=<YOUR_DOMAIN>`

Then add your domain to the `domain.txt` file in the repo by opening a PR.

### Why?

Because web rings are cool and should come back. Also because beavers build dams.
